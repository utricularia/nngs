-- NNGS SERVER README
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The files contained in this tarball comprise the No Name Go Server
(NNGS) source code.

For licencing information, see the file COPYING.


>> COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION

Before compiling, read and edit src/nngsconfig.h and src/nngsmain.h
Things like mail program locations are specified therein.
You may also want to check config.h after running ./configure

Configure and compile mlrate and then NNGS.  Here's how:
(current version numbers may be different...)

tar xvzf mlrate-1.1.0.tar.gz
cd mlrate-1.1.0
./configure
make
cd ..

_READ_ the README file in the mlrate directory.  It contains much useful
information on how to set up the ratings system to work properly.

tar xvzf nngs-1.1.3.tar.gz
cd nngs-1.1.3
ln -s ../mlrate-1.1.0 mlrate
./configure --prefix=/whatever/dir/you/want
make install

The 'make install' command installs the server and all basic
help files necessary for its functionality.

To run and test it:
$prefix/bin/nngssrv
telnet localhost 9696



>> DATA FILES

Data and logfiles will be in $prefix/share/nngssrv/*

Several files need to be installed manually to avoid killing them
when you update the server.

In $prefix/share/nngssrv/ladder you will find two example ladder
files.  Copy them (or remame them) to remove the '.example'

In $prefix/share/nngssrv/messages you will find default message
files for login, logout, etc.  Rename them to remove the 'default.'
part to activate them.



>> DEVELOPMENT

The server code is undergoing development and contributions are
welcome.  See:

<http://people.debian.org/~lohner/nngs>

for the latest status and sources.
Contributions and suggestions are welcome.

When sending patches that span several files, please use
diff -ruN <orig-dir> <modified-dir>
